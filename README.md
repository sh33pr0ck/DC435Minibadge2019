Based on the minibadge by luke jenkins: https://github.com/lukejenkins/minibadge

Arduino code uses a tutorial I found on adafruit and edited to for the correct pinout. The LED is a common anode rgb.

Use the icsp pads with a programmer to load code to the attiny85.

I'll add the schematics etc. soon.
